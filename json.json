It's a critical component of security, ensuring that only authorized individuals can access protected resources. This involves confirming that the entity claiming an identity is indeed who or what it claims to be.\n\n## Key Concepts\n- **Username/Password:** The traditional method, relying on a user providing credentials.\n- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Enhancing security by requiring multiple forms of verification.\n- **Single Sign-On (SSO):** Allowing users to access multiple applications with a single set of credentials.\n\n## Step-by-Step Guide\n1. User requests access to a resource.\n2. The system prompts for credentials (username/password).\n3. The system verifies the credentials against a database or directory.\n4. Upon successful verification, access is granted.\n\n## Real-World Applications\nEveryday examples include logging into your email, online banking, or social media accounts.  These systems utilize authentication to ensure only authorized users can access sensitive data.\n\n## Summary\nAuthentication is the cornerstone of secure access to systems and resources.  Understanding its core principles is essential for building secure applications.",
